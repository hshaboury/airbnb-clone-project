# Airbnb Clone — Full-Stack Project
A learning project to build a functional clone of the Airbnb accommodation platform. 
The app will let users browse property listings, view details, and complete bookings while we practice real-world full‑stack web development workflows.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Implement responsive, user-friendly UI/UX
- Structure a complex web application with clear folders and components
- Practice team collaboration with defined roles and Git workflows
- Apply best practices for clean, maintainable code
- Prepare for deployment (CI/CD, hosting) later in the project

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (initial)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or similar framework)
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub
- **Design Tools:** Figma for UI/UX design

> Note: Backend APIs, database, and deployment setup will be added in later milestones.

## 📄 Primary Pages (planned)
- **Property Listing View:** Grid of available properties with filters
- **Listing Detailed View:** Full details, image gallery, booking form
- **Simple Checkout View:** Streamlined payment & booking confirmation

## 🔑 Key Features (planned)
- Property search & filtering
- Detailed property pages
- Secure checkout flow
- User authentication

## ✅ Best Practices
- Mobile‑first, responsive design
- Reusable component patterns
- Accessibility (WCAG) considerations
- Feature branches & meaningful commits
- Unit & integration testing as the app grows

## 🚀 Getting Started (coming soon)
This section will include steps to run the project locally once we scaffold the app structure.
